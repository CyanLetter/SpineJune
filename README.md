...or Spine June, or Spine Unity Demo, or whatever. This is a quick project, put together over a couple of weeks worth of spare time. It is meant to be a technical demo of Spine animation and 2D lighting in Unity. For those digging into it, it is also a horrible mess.

All game assets are free to use. If you make something cool, we'd love to check it out!
